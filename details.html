            <p>Now that you’ve decided you want to start working out, how exactly do you pick the lifts you want to do?</p>
            <p>First off, you want to create a workout split. In a standard split, people will do push, pull, and leg days.</p>
            <img src="https://blogs.rdxsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Featured-image.jpg" alt="Weightlifting Image">
            <ul>
                <li>Push typically includes the chest, triceps, and shoulders. It’s called a “push day” as you do these exercises in a pushing motion.</li>
                <li>Conversely, you have “pull” days which typically include the biceps and back muscles. These exercises include pulling motions.</li>
                <li>Leg days can be split into two separate days (which is what I do) or done together, it truly is whatever your personal goals are. The two splits for legs are typically broken into hamstrings and glutes, then quadriceps and calves.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Secondly, you want to decide on how many sets, reps (repetition), and weight you want to do.</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>A typical amount of sets are 4-5</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>The reps you decide to do depend on your goals!</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>High reps low weight is good for <b>building endurance and strength</b></li>
                <li>Low reps high weight is good for <b>building muscle mass</b></li>
                <li>If you’re at a beginner level, <b>high reps and low weight</b> is a great starting point!</li>
            </ul>
