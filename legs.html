            <h2>Quadriceps/Calves</h>
            <h2>Ex: 4x8-10 (4 sets of 8-10 reps)</h2>
            <h3>*Reminder: Always do a warm-up set to avoid injury*</h3>
        <section>
            <h3>1. Barbell Squats</h3>
            <p>First, set up the squat rack to your desired height where you're comfortable unracking/reracking the barbell. 
                Then, start by warming up with just the bar to get your form correct. 
                Make sure that your feet are shoulder-length apart, brace your core, drive your hips back and bend your knees.
                Raise back up after you feel like you've gotten a good range of motion.</p>

            <h3>2. Leg Press</h3>    
            <p>Start by pushing just the sled, keeping your feet shoulder width apart. There are different stances you can try, based on your goals (as seen below)</p>

            <h3>3. Quad Extension</h3>

            <h3>4. Calf Raises</h3>  
            <p>Grab two dumbbells and find an empty space. Simply raise your calves up and down. <b>Optional:</b> Place a plate/risen surface underneath your toes for a larger range of motion.</p>

            <h1>Hamstrings/Glutes</h1>
            <h2>Ex: 4x8-10 (4 sets of 8-10 reps)</h2>
            <h3>*Reminder: Always do a warm-up set to avoid injury*</h3>
        <section>
            <h3>1. Goodmornings</h3>
            <p>Similar to the squat, you're going to set up the squat rack to your preferred settings. Instead of bending your knees to squat, however, you're going to lean forward and push your hips back until you feel tension in your hamstrings. </p>

            <h3>2. Romanian Dead Lift (RDL)</h3>    
            <p>Set up the squat rack (or two dumbbells) to have the bar at your shin. If you're using a squat rack, make sure to remove the safeguards on the side. Pick up the barbell and similar to the goodmorning, push your hips back.</p>
            <p><b>Tip: pretend you're trying to sit in a chair (without going all the way down!) and keep your neck & back neutral</b></p>

            <h3>3. Hamstring Curls</h3>
            <p>As pictured:</p>

            <h3>4. Hip Thrust</h3>
            <p>Grab a barbell and a bench. Some people put a lifting pad or towel between them and the barbell to protect the hip bones. First, sit down in front of the bench with your feet slightly wider than shoulder-length apart. Place the barbell across your hip bone and hold the bar to keep it in place. Activate your glutes and push your hips into the bar until its in a straight alignment, then slowly lower the bar and hips until its a few inches off the ground. Repeat! </p>

            <h3>5. Bulgarian Split Squat</h3>
            <p>Grab two dumbbells and a bench. Stand ~2 feet in front of a bench and first extend your right leg behind you, resting your toes on the bench. Lean your body forward, holding a singular dumbbell in each hand and bend your single knee in a squat motion. Try to keep your neck and back neutral. </p>
